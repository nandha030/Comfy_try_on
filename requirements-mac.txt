# Comify Virtual Try-On - macOS Requirements
# Supports: macOS 12+ on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel Macs
#
# Installation:
#   1. Create virtual environment: python3 -m venv venv
#   2. Activate: source venv/bin/activate
#   3. Install base requirements: pip install -r requirements-base.txt
#   4. Install macOS requirements: pip install -r requirements-mac.txt
#
# PyTorch installation (required before this file):
#   # For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) - MPS acceleration:
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
#
#   # For Intel Mac (CPU only):
#   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

# ============== OpenCV (headless for better compatibility) ==============
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0

# ============== ONNX Runtime ==============
# macOS uses CPU-based ONNX runtime (MPS not supported by ONNX)
onnxruntime>=1.16.0

# ============== Face Processing ==============
# Note: insightface may require additional setup on macOS
# For Apple Silicon, you may need to install from source or use Rosetta
insightface>=0.7.3

# ============== ControlNet ==============
controlnet-aux>=0.0.7

# ============== Image Enhancement ==============
# Note: realesrgan works but may be slower on Apple Silicon
realesrgan>=0.3.0
basicsr>=1.4.2

# ============== macOS-specific dependencies ==============
# These help with Apple Silicon compatibility
pyobjc-core>=9.0; sys_platform == "darwin"
pyobjc-framework-Cocoa>=9.0; sys_platform == "darwin"
